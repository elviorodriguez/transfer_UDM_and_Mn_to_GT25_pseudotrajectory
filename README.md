# transfer_UDM_and_Mn_to_GT25_pseudotrajectory
This code was used to transfer the UDM and Mn2+ atoms from 2APC crystal structure to the pseudo-trajectories of wild-type and mutant GT25.

The output directory contains the final pseudo-trajectories of wild-type (GT.pdb) and mutant (GTmut.pdb) versions of GT25.
